Hi World

I am the first of many GEDI - Grace Enables Developers of Information to come.

My true power is not my many gifts from God. Rather it is my recognition that those gifts from God are not enough for me to realize his plan for me. I need him more than anything else!

Which is also why daily devotionals are important.
